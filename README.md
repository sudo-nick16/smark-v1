# Smark 
Smark is a basic site that lets you store hyperlinks which you wish to visit later or are important to you, its kinda like bookmarks feature in browsers but Smark lets you add the site without you having to open it in your browser, all you have to do is copy-paste or manually type the url in the input box. It's a basic project that i made while learning Javascript.
